## Summary of Application

This application allows a two-player game to be played, Tic Tac Toe - Dinos vs. Meteors! The game starts out with player one, the Dino, who places a token on the game board. The players take turns placing tokens on the grid, until the player that gets 3 tokens in a row wins. If no one can get three in a row, the game results in a draw. The status of wins for Dinos vs. Meteors is displayed on the sidebars of the application, and they save to local devices. Think about the baby Dinos!

## Instructions for Running/Viewing

1. On page load, the user sees an empty game board, a grid with 9 spaces. The middle heading indicates who's turn it is and who should place a token on the board next. The sidebars have icons indicating the number of wins each player has. The default first player is dino. (Fig. A)

2. Once a player places a token on the board, it's the next player's turn. The middle heading changes to reflect this. (Fig. B, C)

3. The first player to get three tokens in a row wins. The middle heading indicates the winner, and the number in the winning player's sidebar reflects the number of wins. (Fig. D, E)

4. If no player is able to get three in a row, the middle heading changes to "It's a draw!". (Fig. F)

5. After reaching either a draw or a win, simply click on the game board to clear the tokens and play a new game.

## Future Additions

- Let players save a game card to their sidebar after each win. Persist across refreshes.

- Styling updates - fade-ins, animations, and better background and dimensions.

- Add button to reset saved wins.

- Let user restart a game.

## Reflections/Wins

- Very happy to have full functionality within the due date, since I was struggling with the logic a lot at first. However, some things could be improved, such as the Game methods and some bulky functions. I was surprised at how little lines of code it took to build this application.
